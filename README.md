# Stock Ordering Algorithm
Welcome to the Warung Stock Ordering Algorithm repository! This project aims to revolutionize inventory management for warungs (small shops) across Indonesia. Our algorithm utilizes historical stock data to recommend precise replenishment quantities, enabling warung owners to optimize their inventory, maximize profits, and streamline operations.

*Key Features*:
- Analyzes the last four days of stock quantity history to generate replenishment recommendations.
- Categorizes stock into red (needs replenishment), yellow (excess stock), and green (optimal stock).
- Facilitates informed purchasing decisions, leading to higher inventory turnover and better cash flow management.
